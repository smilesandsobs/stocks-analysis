# Stocks-Analysis


### Overview of this project

This is an analysis of a dataset of thousands of Green Energy Stocks for a friends (Steve) parents. Using Excels VBA or Visual Basic for Applications I have scriped code which will loop and pull data for 12 different tickers (stocks).  

The purpose of this analysis was to compare the green energy stock DAQO, in which Steves parents were currently invested, with other green energy stocks. Looking at their total volume and return for the periods of 2017 and 2018. This could help inform Steve how best to advise his parents to invest their money while following their values and investing sustainably.
